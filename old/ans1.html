<p><b>Q1. Why does Venus have very shallow craters ?
</b>
</p>
<p><b>Ans. Venus has shallow craters because they were formed after Venus was
resurfaced. Since then, there has been very little geologic activity and weathering. Furthermore, small projectiles vaporize or break up in the
Venusian atmosphere before they reach the surface, so the possibility of their making new huge craters is also diminished.<br>

Q4. One of the strangest observatories is located in a mine in South Dakota, USA. What does it observe?
</p>

<p>Ans. Solar neutrinos. It has a chlorine detector with 470 metric tonnes of fluid used to
measure deficit of electron neutrino from Sun. ( There were varied answers to
this, including hail stones and seismic activity!)<br>
<br>
Q5. The object shown in the image is a highly luminous hypergiant double star. Estimates of its mass range from 100–150 times the mass of the Sun, and its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.
What is it?

Q6. How long is the longest total solar eclipse in the solar system from any moon?
