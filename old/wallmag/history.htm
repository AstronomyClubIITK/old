		Most ancient cultures saw pictures in the stars of the night sky. The 
		earliest known efforts to catalogue the stars, with cuneiform texts and 
		artifacts, dates back roughly 6000 years. These remnants found in the 
		valley of the Euphrates River, suggest that the ancients observing the 
		heavens saw the lion, the bull, and the scorpion in the stars. The 
		constellations as we know them today are undoubtedly very different from 
		those first few. Our night sky is a compendium of images from a number 
		of different societies, both ancient and modern. By far, though, we owe 
		the greatest debt to the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

		<span style="font-size: 9pt" lang="HI">The earliest references to the 
		mythological significance of the Greek constellations may be found in 
		the work of great Homer, which probably dates to the 7th century B.C. In 
		Iliad, for instance, Homer describes the creation of Achilleus's shield 
		by the Craftsman God Hephaistos. On it he made the earth, and sky, and 
		sea, the weariless sun and the moon waxing full, and all the 
		constellations that </span></font>
		<span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #FFFFFF" lang="HI">crown the 
		heavens, Pleiades and Hyades, the mighty Orion and the Bear, which men 
		also call by the name of Wain. <span style>&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

		At the time of Homer, however, most of the constellations were not 
		associated with any particular myth, hero, or god. They were instead 
		known simply as the objects or animals which they represented--the Lyre, 
		for instance, or the Ram. By the 5th century B.C., however, most of the 
		constellations had come to be associated with myths, and the 
		Catasterismi of Eratosthenes completed the mythologization of the stars. 
		&quot;At this stage, the fusion between astronomy and mythology is so 
		complete that no further distinction is made between them&quot;(Seznec, 
		37-40)--the stars were no longer merely identified with certain gods or 
		heroes, but actually were perceived as divine </span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 9pt" lang="HI">Despite many mentions of the 
		stars in Greek and early Roman texts, by far the most thorough star 
		catalogue from ancient times belongs to<span style>&nbsp; </span>Ptolemy of 
		Alexandria. This Roman grouped 1022 star into 48 constellations during 
		the 2nd century A.D. Although Ptolemy's Almagest does not include the 
		constellations, which may only be seen from the southern hemisphere, it 
		forms the basis for the modern list of 88 constellations officially 
		designated by the international Astronomical Union (Pasachoff, 134-135). 
		The influence of both the Greek and Roman cultures may be plainly seen. 
		Though we use their Latin names, the myths behind the constellations 
		date back to ancient Greece.</span></font></p>
