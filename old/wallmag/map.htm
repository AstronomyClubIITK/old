<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the minds wobbling questions in 
this respect are the following: -</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">What does the universe look like on the 
very largest scales?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">How much matter does it contain?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">What are the biggest things that exist?
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">To answer such questions, astronomers 
are measuring the redshifts (and thus distances) of thousands of galaxies to map 
gigantic slices of the universe in three dimensions. </font></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The largest such 
survey to date is the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, being carried out with the 
4-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope in Australia. So far it has measured the 
redshifts of 106,000 galaxies, four times more than any previous effort. They 
lie within two pizza-slice wedges of sky about 3-deg. thick, 90-deg. wide and 
extending out some 2 billion light-years from Earth, to a redshift of 0.25. The 
survey's goal is to collect 250,000 galaxy redshifts. Team members Gavin B. 
Dalton (Oxford University) and Karl Glazebrook (Johns Hopkins University) 
presented a map of the wedges of space surveyed to date. </font></p>

<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">Seen on such a 
gigantic scale, the cosmos is a filamentary network of galaxy clusters, 
superclusters, voids, and &quot;great walls&quot; up to 500 million light-years long. 
Never before has a three-dimensional map spanned so many of them. One result the 
astronomers announced was that they found the largest structures that exist. At 
last, they have a map of space large enough to see that there are no structures 
as big as the map itself. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">Another result 
is even more important: a newly reliable measure of the total density of matter 
in the universe, based on the gravity exerted by the largest galaxy clusters. 
&quot;The idea is simple,&quot; said Dalton. &quot;Near large concentrations of galaxies, the 
expansion of the universe is slowed down by their gravitational pull. We can 
measure this slowing and estimate the mass of the concentrations. By analyzing 
the results of the whole survey, we can directly measure the mass of the 
universe.&quot; </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">Their result? 
The density of all matter comes to 40 percent, plus or minus 10 percent, of the 
density that would be needed to render space &quot;flat.&quot; The inflation theory of the 
Big Bang predicts that space is flat, and flatness as dramatically proven by two 
balloon-borne experiments last month. The mass measured by the 2dF team doesn't 
measure up -- in agreement with many other groups' previous results. The team 
determined the gravity of both ordinary matter and the larger amount of &quot;dark 
matter,&quot; made of some kind of unknown particles, that resides in galaxy 
clusters. This does not, however, include the recently discovered &quot;dark energy&quot; 
(the so-called cosmological constant or vacuum energy) that apparently exists in 
just the right amount to make up the deficit and bring the total density to 1.0.

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The 2dF survey 
is not the only great cosmic mapping program underway. The Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey (SDSS) is working in parallel to map different parts of the sky to 
complete our understanding of the &quot;look and feel&quot; of our universe. </font></p>
