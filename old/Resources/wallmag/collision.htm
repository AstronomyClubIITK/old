<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Stars are too far apart to collide with 
each other. That's what every basic astronomy book says, and in the Sun's part 
of the galaxy it's true -- fortunately for us. But in regions much richer in 
stars, such as dense clusters, stellar smashups occasionally ought to happen. On 
Wednesday, June 7th, Rex A. Saffer (Villanova University) announced</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">what he called &quot;the first direct 
evidence of stellar collisions and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">mergers.&quot; </font></p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">Saffer studied 
so-called &quot;blue straggler&quot; stars in the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. Blue 
stragglers are main-sequence stars that have too much mass -- and therefore 
shine too bright and blue -- for the age of the cluster in which they reside. 
For instance, NGC 6397 is so old that all of its stars with more than 0.8 times 
the mass of the Sun should have already evolved off the main sequence, become 
giants, and died. But the blue stragglers haven't done so. This means that 
somehow, they must have gained their large masses relatively recently. </font>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The theory all 
along has been that this happens when two low-mass stars collide and merge into 
one. Such mergers could happen two ways, Saffer explained. Members of a binary 
star could be perturbed and thrown together if a third star gets captured into 
the system. Or two free-flying stars could bang into each other directly. </font>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">Direct 
collisions probably created five blue stragglers in the cluster's dense core, 
said Saffer. Four of these all have about 1.6 solar masses, twice the maximum 
allowed for any star that has been around since the cluster's birth. The fifth 
contains about 2.4 solar masses, meaning it must have formed by the coalescence 
of three or more stars. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The merging of binaries should produce 
a wider variety of masses than these values. A binary origin probably does 
account for the blue</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">stragglers found in the cluster's outer 
regions, said Saffer, but at the core, &quot;the mass distribution argues strongly 
for a direct collisional origin.&quot;</font></p>
