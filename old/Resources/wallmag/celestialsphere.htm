	<span style="font-family: Verdana">The stars are at a very large distance 
	from us. So the relative movement between them is of no consequence to 
	day-to-day observations. We therefore imagine the stars to remain fixed on a 
	sphere of very large radius with the earth at its centre. We call this 
	sphere the <b style>celestial sphere</b>.</span></font></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">At any point of time we can only see the 
	upper half of the celestial sphere. The point on this dome right above our 
	head is known as <b style>zenith</b>. The lower boundary of this dome is the
	<b style>horizon</b>. As the surface is 2-dimensional, to specify the 
	position of any star on this dome we need two coordinates. We usually use a 
	spherical polar coordinate system and ignore ‘r’. One system is the <b style>
	alt-azimuth </b>system. The shortest line (great circle) is drawn from the 
	zenith joining the star right down to the horizon. The angle the star makes 
	above the horizon measured along this line is known as <b style>altitude</b>. 
	The position of this line with respect to some fixed reference is known as
	<b style>azimuth</b>. Usually the <b style>meridian</b> line (the line 
	joining the zenith and the pole star) is taken as the reference and angle of 
	meridian is measured westward from it. </span></font></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Due to rotation of the earth, the entire 
	celestial sphere appears to rotate around the earth, once in about 24 hours. 
	There are two points on the sphere, which do not move – they are the
	<b style>celestial north and south poles</b>. If we extend the axis of the 
	earth to meet the celestial sphere, it would cut the latter at these two 
	points. Very close to the celestial North Pole (for all practical purposes, 
	right at the celestial north pole) lies the famous Pole star or North Star 
	(systematic name: &#945;-Ursae Minoris.). This star remains fixed in its 
	position. At any latitude &#955; in the northern hemisphere, the altitude of the 
	pole star is &#955; above the horizon. All the other stars seem to rotate around 
	the North Star in circles in the anticlockwise sense (think why?). The 
	further the (angular) distance of the star from the pole star, the greater 
	its radius of the traced circle.</span></font></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">When the angular distance increases to 
	90º, the traced circle becomes a great circle – the <b style>celestial 
	equator</b>. If we extend the plane containing the equator in space, the 
	circle formed by its intersection with the celestial sphere is known as the 
	celestial equator. As the angular distance exceeds 90º, the circles traced 
	become smaller and smaller.</span></font></p>

	<font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt" face="Verdana">At any latitude 
	in the Northern Hemisphere there will some stars that are always above the 
	horizon (in fact all stars less than &#955; from the pole). If we draw a line 
	from the North Star through where we are standing to intersect the celestial 
	sphere in the south at &#955; below the horizon, we will get the celestial South 
	Pole. There will be some stars around the South Pole that will always be 
	below the horizon. The rotation in 24 hrs is 360º. Simple calculation shows 
	that in 1 hr it is 15º and it is 1º in 4 minutes.</font></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">The sun moves along with the celestial 
	sphere but together with that it shifts every day a bit to the east with 
	respect to the celestial sphere. This is due to the westward revolution of 
	the earth. As the period is 365 days, the sun moves 360º/365 = 1º (approx) 
	in one day. Now, the time we follow is based in the rising and setting of 
	the sun (<b style>solar time</b>). Any star moves 1º to the west with 
	respect to the sun in one day and hence rises 4 minutes earlier. After 1 
	month it rises 2 hours earlier. So we see different stars during different 
	seasons. The path taken by the sun the celestial sphere is known as the line 
	of <b style>ecliptic</b> to which we will come later.</span></font></p>
