	<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The 
	distant planet Uranus has been a fruitful target for planetary observers 
	lately, with five satellites discovered telescopically within the last three 
	years. (A sixth, discovered last year in Voyager images from 1986, awaits 
	confirmation.) Three of the new moonlets were spotted in July 1999 by an 
	international collaboration of astronomers working at the Canada-France 
	Hawaii Telescope atop Mauna Kea.</span></font></p>

	<span style>&nbsp;</span>In the last few months further observations were used to 
	refine their orbits, and today astronomers meeting in Manchester, England, 
	formally numbered the satellites and adopted provisional names for them. All 
	three are characters from Shakespeare's The Tempest.</span></font></p>

	Prospero</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 9pt"> (formerly S/1999 U 3, 
	now numbered XVIII) is 16.1 million kilometers from Uranus on average and 
	takes 5.33 years to complete one orbit. In The Tempest, Prospero is a 
	powerful magician who enslaves Ariel (the name of another Uranian 
	satellite). </span></font></p>

	Setebos</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 9pt"> (formerly S/1999 U 1, 
	now XIX) has the most eccentric orbit, which ranges in distance from 8.1 to 
	27.1 million km and has a period of 6.12 years. Setebos, the god of Sycorax, 
	is mentioned several times in Shakespeare's play. </span></font></p>

	Stephano </span></i></b><span style="font-size: 9pt">(formerly S/1999 U 2, 
	now XX) takes 1.85 years to circle Uranus at an average distance of 7.9 
	million km. Serving as a butler on Ariel's ship, Stephano and Caliban plot 
	to murder Prospero. Although the monikers received unanimous approval by the 
	IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, they will remain 
	provisional until approved by the Task Group for Outer-Planet Nomenclature 
	and then its General Assembly. The discovery team includes Brett Gladman, 
	Jean-Marc Petit, and Hans Scholl (all of the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur

	Holman (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, U.S.). </span></font>
