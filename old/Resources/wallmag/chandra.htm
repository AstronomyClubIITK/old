<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In the 11 months since the Chandra 
X-ray Observatory was launched into orbit, X-ray astronomy has gotten a big shot 
in the arm. Several astronomers who have been using it shared recent findings 
with colleagues and the press on Tuesday and Wednesday, June 6th and 7th. Among 
the objects they highlighted were weird structures around the Vela pulsar, an 
X-ray bright planetary nebula, and an extremely high-energy galactic jet. </font>
</p>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The Vela pulsar 
is a very young neutron star about 1,000 light-years away spinning 11 times a 
second. It's the tiny, dense remnant of a supernova that exploded about 10,000 
years ago. The pulsar is only about 20 kilometers wide, but its surface is so 
hot (2 million degrees Kelvin) that it shines very brilliantly in X-rays, 
showing up as a bright dot in Chandra's images. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The Vela pulsar 
is known for its &quot;glitches&quot;: sudden, slight changes in spin rate. A major glitch 
occurred on January 16th, and shortly thereafter Chandra homed in for a look. 
Current theories of how glitches work predict that the pulsar's surface should 
have been heated slightly as a result. But Chandra found its temperature to be 
holding rock steady to at least one part in 300. Glitch theorists will have to 
go back to the drawing board. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">An intriguing 
little nebula showing complex structure surrounds the pulsar. In the top image 
shown above, the two bright arcs appear to be the near sides of two nested 
rings. Jets emerge from the pulsar perpendicular to the rings and presumably 
mark the neutron star's rotational poles. Intriguingly, the jets are lined up 
precisely with the direction in which the pulsar is moving across the sky at 100 
km per second. This duplicates a similar jet-and-motion alignment found earlier 
for the Crab Nebula pulsar, an even younger supernova remnant. Some astronomers 
had wondered whether this alignment in the Crab was a coincidence, apparently 
not. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">&quot;It's very 
tempting to assume that the jet acts like a rocket to accelerate the pulsar,&quot; 
George V. Pavlov (Penn State University) told assembled science reporters on 
Tuesday. The jets carry little mass but move with extreme speeds. They consist 
of particles accelerated by an electric field as strong as hundreds of billions 
of volts per centimeter near the pulsar's poles. The pulsar’s superstrong 
magnetic field and fast spin generate this electric field. If the jet from one 
pole is stronger than the jet from the other, its rocket effect, lasting for 
thousands of years, might indeed be enough to accelerate pulsars to their 
observed high speeds, suggested Pavlov. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The mainstream 
explanation, on the other hand, is that supernova explode asymmetrically and 
impart a kick to their pulsar offspring at birth. If so, the jets seen by 
Chandra suggest that the kick be somehow imparted along the exploding star's 
axis of rotation.</font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 9pt">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Another team of astronomers used 
Chandra to examine a tiny, young</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">planetary nebula -- and found it to 
contain shocked, X-ray-hot gas as theory predicts. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">A bubble of gas 
surrounds the dying star BD+30 3639 about 5,000 to 8,000 light-years away. Fast 
winds emitted by the hot white dwarf at its center should collide with slower 
material ejected earlier, heating it to X-ray temperatures of millions of 
degrees. Joel H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology) displayed a picture 
of the first proof that this is happening. Chandra also found the spectral 
signature of neon in the hot gas, showing that it contains material dredged up 
from the deepest layers of the central star. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The workings of 
planetary nebulae could have broad implications. The beautifully symmetrical, a 
companion orbiting the outgassing star -- a companion that in some cases could 
be as small as Jupiter, may cause bipolar shapes shown by most planetaries. &quot;The 
asymmetries we see in planetary nebulae could be telling us something about 
these stars' planets,&quot; said Kastner. An expanding giant star could engulf a 
Jupiter late in life, which would spin it up to a faster rotation rate, Kastner 
explained. The spin would eventually shape the ejected nebula. Alternatively, a 
larger-mass companion orbiting farther away could gravitationally shepherd a 
planetary's gaseous outflow.</font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">The giant radio 
galaxy Pictor A is the most powerful radio emitter within 650 million 
light-years. Chandra showed that it is also emitting a very thin particle beam 
at least 800,000 light-years long. The beam crashes into the far ends of great 
lobes of gas that are seen at radio wavelengths on either side of the galaxy.
</font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="font-size: 9pt">In the region of 
the crash, explained Andrew S. Wilson (University of Maryland), electrons must 
get accelerated to speeds so close to the speed of light that each carries 100 
million times more energy than resides in its own mass. &quot;This is the first time 
such acceleration has been seen so far away from a galaxy.&quot; We may be looking at 
one of the sources of very-high-energy cosmic ray particles. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">You may regard a Galaxy as an island of 
stars. At first site, all of them appear as a hazy patch in sky but as you focus 
your vision you will discover that they have some characteristic geometry. 
Differences do lie in their appearances. Out of 2000 observed galaxies only 3% 
have no symmetry so they are called &quot;Irregular&quot; type of galaxies. The rest are 
either elliptical called ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES or spirals called SPIRAL GALAXIES. 
Former type is less abundant only 20% and the latter ones occupy most of the 
list i.e.77%.</font></p>

classification of galaxies. This can be put very aptly in a diagram known as 
hubble tuning fork.</font></p>

pointed out these type don't have any symmetry. They are very few in numbers. 
The nearest to us, belonging to this type is known as the Large Magllenic cloud 
(LMC) and the Small Magllenic cloud (SMC). These are the most celebrated of its 
kind. Other well known includes M82 and NGC5192. LMC and SMC are important for 
studying irregular galaxies in details and observing star evolution in these 
galaxies. Unfortunately, it is not visible from mid-northern latitudes. Whenever 
if you ever have a chance to go Madras or any other southern place, don't forget 
to gaze at it!</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">These are quite abundant in our 
universe. Out of observed galaxies, 20% are of this type. These galaxies are 
beautifully symmetric but featureless. Since an ellipse has eccentricity as one 
of its parameters, one parameter is needed to say more precisely about what type 
of elliptic the galaxy is. For astronomical uses term ellipticity is used to do 
so, which is defined as</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">10*(1-b/a)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">where a is semimajor axis and b is 
semiminor axis of the ellipse we are considering (i.e. the galaxy).</font></p>

semiminor axes as 10' and 5' is E5 as </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">10(1-5/10) = 5</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Thus a galaxy appearing circular need 
not be a circle it may be elliptical. Most flattened one is E7. Regular galaxies 
flatter than this are all spirals. Celebrated elliptic galaxies are M87 (Virgo), 
NGC205 (the satellite galaxy of andromeda).</font></p>

scheme. There are many but this is the most basic and quite adequate for any

being that this classification is morphological rather than physical. It is 
quite likely that an E7 type can be misinterpreted as E0 etc.</font></p>

atmosphere before they collide with nitrogen or oxygen molecules in the air. The 
collision destroys the cosmic ray particle and the air molecule, and then 
several new particles emerge. Cosmic rays from space are termed &quot;primary,&quot; and 
any particles created in the atmosphere from collisions are termed &quot;secondary.&quot;
