ORIGIN OF COMET HALE-BOPP<br>
It sounds like a recipe for an astronomy-type video game: first launch a rocket 
equipped with a telescope into a 5-minute<br>
suborbital flight. Then when it gets stabilized, turn the controls over to a 
pair of scientists and let them use a joystick to point<br>
the telescope at a bright comet. The result? The first-ever detection of the 
noble gas argon in a comet -- and a peek into the<br>
deep-freeze of the early solar<br>
nebula where the comet formed.<br>
On Monday, S. Alan Stern, a researcher with Texas-based Southwest<br>
Research Institute reported on the analysis of spectroscopic data collected on 
March 29, 1997, by a rocket-borne extreme<br>
ultraviolet (EUV) telescope and spectrometer launched from New Mexico’s White 
Sands Missile Range. When Stern and his<br>
team finished reducing their data just recently, they saw the unmistakable 
signature of argon gas.<br>
Its presence tells a lot. The argon would have been completely driven off if the 
bulk of the comet’s nucleus had ever<br>
experienced temperatures of even 30 or 35 deg. Kelvin since its formation at the 
beginning of the solar system’s history. On<br>
the other hand, the rocket team found no trace of neon in Hale-Bopp. Neon is 
driven off at about 20 deg. Kelvin, implying<br>
that the nucleus was heated at least to that temperature.<br>
This tight constraint on Hale-Bopp’s heating history implies that the comet most 
likely formed in the cold reaches of the solar<br>
system near where Uranus and Neptune are now -- farther out than astronomers had 
expected.<br>
Stern and his colleagues, including Michael A’Hearn of the University of 
Maryland and Michel Festou of the Observatoire<br>
de Midi-Pyrenees in France, plan to study other comets using the same technique 
with better instruments. In coming years<br>
they hope to check comets Wirtanen, Machholz 1, and Encke for the presence or 
absence of other gases that should have<br>
existed in the early solar system. &quot;This is very exciting to us,&quot; Stern said. 
&quot;When we look at these comets with other flights,<br>
we’ll be studying emissions of other species that tell us about what conditions 
might have been like in the early solar system.&quot;</font></p>
