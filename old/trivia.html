<p class = "small"><u>Quiz section</u></p>
First quiz has been released on our newsgroup. It was given during the
introductory lecture.
<br><br>
1.	When a total lunar eclipse occurs, what phase should the moon be in?<br>
<br>
2.	The Great Red Spot is found on Jupiter. Where would you find the Great Dark Spot?<br>
<br>
3.	What are the concentric gaps in the asteroid belt called?<br>
<br>
4.	The Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) , a particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva was one of the largest scientific instrument ever constructed ( 27 Km in circumference!). Connect LEP and a fundamental particle discovered in 1983 and the Moon.<br>
<br>
5.	To the right is are a few drawings by Galileo of something he saw and interpreted as two satellites around a planet. What is it actually?<br>
<br>
6.	The angular diameter of this celestial body is 4 degrees, nearly eight times that of the moon. Easily visible to the naked eye on clear nights, it was first documented by the Persian astronomer Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi. Name it.<br>
<br>
7.	Forest fires in western Canada in Sept ,1950 and the Volcanic explosion in Krakatoa , Indonesia in 1883 (considered to be the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded history) gave rise to a weather phenomenon whose name is still in usage ,although in a different context.Which Phenomenon are we talking about ?
<p><b>Answers (in black, select or press Ctrl+A to view)</b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">1. Full moon<br>
<br>
2. Neptune<br>
<br>
3. Kirkwood Gaps<br>
<br>
4. The connection is that the Moon's tidal interaction causes deformation of about a millimter in the 27 Km circumference Ring of the LEP , the particle accelerator shown in the picture.This deformation caused an error in the estimates of the Mass of the Z Boson( a fundamental particle which was being investigated at CERN) by about 0.02%.See the CERN bulletin which tells all about this and other wierd effects like how the level of water in the nearby lake Geneva affected the results ! (http://bulletin.cern.ch/9809/art1/Text_E.html)<br>
<br>
5. Rings of Saturn<br>
<br>
6. Andromeda galaxy<br>
<br>
7. Blue moon</font><br>
